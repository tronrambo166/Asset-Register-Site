		<p>To report an item stolen you must first create an account and register your item. <br /> You can do that by clicking here.</p>
		<p>Once registered you can report your item stolen within your <a href="bikerack.php">Assets</a> page.
        If your item is spotted by another user they can contact the police, aiding in the safe recovery of your item.â€‹</p>
		<p>Reporting your item stolen does not guarantee its return, however it does significantly increases the chances. Thieves are much less likely to steal registered bikes.</p>
		<p>Random checks on bikes can be undertaken by searching either serial number, colour, model, and make. It's important all these parameters are recorded. This will make it much easier for your stolen bike to be identify your bike.</p>
